# Open Automation Playground

**Welcome!** This is the documentation for so called [Open Automation Playground](https://github.com/datakurre/automation-playground/): a preconfigured and opinionated virtual desktop for mostly open source process automation with [Camunda Zeebe](https://camunda.com/platform/zeebe/) process orchestrator and [Robot Framework](https://robotframework.org/) with  [RCC toolchain](https://robocorp.com/docs/rcc/overview) (and [parrot-rcc](https://github.com/datakurre/parrot-rcc/)).

The playground is a standalone virtual desktop environment and requires neither [Camunda](https://camunda.com/platform/) nor [Robocorp Cloud](https://robocorp.com/docs/control-room) to function. [Robocon 2023 workshop](https://robocon.io#business-process-automation-with-robot-framework-and-camunda-platform) participants will have access to dedicated cloud virtual machines with playground installed, but the [playground is also avaible for VirtualBox with Vagrant](vagrant).
